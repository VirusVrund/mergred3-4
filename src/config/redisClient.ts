/**
 * @file src/config/redis.ts
 *
 * @description
 * This module is responsible for configuring and managing the Redis client
 * used across the application.
 *
 * It initializes a Redis client using the official `redis` package and
 * reads the Redis connection URL from environment variables.
 *
 * The Redis client is used by other modules (e.g., rate limiting middleware)
 * to store shared, persistent data such as request counters.
 *
 * A separate `connectRedis` function is exported to explicitly establish
 * the connection during application startup, ensuring the Redis client
 * is connected before being used by other components.
